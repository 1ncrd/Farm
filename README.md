# The_Pig_Farm

This is a small game project based on Qt. It's my programming course final assignment in college. The project mainly uses C++.

## Version 1.0

Implement a part of function including the basic UI, automatical pig growth.
This version use only single threads which causes the interface to be a bit sluggish.

> PS: Actually the program logic is easy to design. The design of graphical interface and the interaction with the data takes a quite long time in that It's my first time to write the code about this.
> The front-end code is so annoying. Sometimes I browsing the browser for a long while just to realize some simple things.

## Version 2.0

The most significant update in this version is that it use multiple threads to separate UI display from data calculation. This greatly improves the interface's smoothnessã€‚
At the same time, it realize a part of function of the display of pig sale records.
